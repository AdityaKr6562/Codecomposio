## Docker Issues

1. If the Docker client is not working:
   - Socket issue: allow use of default socket - https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/issues/159
   - If socket is at a non-standard location - https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/issues/20#issuecomment-2047506005
   - If getting errors like "https+url" is not a valid scheme, update the `requests` package in Python:
    `pip install --upgrade requests`
